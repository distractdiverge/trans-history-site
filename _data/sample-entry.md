## Description

The Stonewall Uprising was a series of spontaneous demonstrations by members of the LGBTQ+ community in response to a police raid that began in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, New York City.

## Historical Context

The Stonewall Inn was one of the few establishments where LGBTQ+ people could socialize openly. Police raids on gay bars were common in this era, but this time, patrons resisted arrest, leading to several nights of protests and clashes with law enforcement.

## Key Figures

- Marsha P. Johnson
- Sylvia Rivera

## Impact

The Stonewall Uprising is widely considered to be the most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
