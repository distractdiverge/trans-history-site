Dr. Harry Benjamin was a German-American physician who became one of the most important early figures in the medical understanding of transgender people. Though he began his career in gerontology, his work with a young patient who wanted to transition led him to dedicate much of his life to studying what he termed "transsexualism."

In 1966, he published his landmark book, *The Transsexual Phenomenon*, which provided a comprehensive and sympathetic overview of the topic. It was the first major scientific work of its kind and proposed a model for diagnosis and treatment that became the foundation for modern transgender healthcare. He argued that for many, transitioning was a medical necessity.

His compassionate approach stood in stark contrast to the prevailing psychiatric view, which treated gender variance as a mental illness to be cured. The professional organization for transgender health, WPATH, was originally named in his honor, cementing his legacy as a foundational figure in the field.
