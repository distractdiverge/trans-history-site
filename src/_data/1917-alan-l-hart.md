Dr. Alan L. Hart was a pioneering American physician and one of the first documented transgender men to undergo medical transition in the United States. Born in Halls Summit, Kansas, Hart was assigned female at birth and named Alberta Lucille Hart. From an early age, he felt and behaved like a boy. He was able to live as a man after seeking psychiatric counseling and undergoing a hysterectomy in 1917.

Hart dedicated his life to medicine, earning a medical degree from the University of Oregon Medical School. His most significant contribution was in the field of radiology. He pioneered the use of X-ray screening to detect tuberculosis in its early stages, a practice that was instrumental in containing the spread of the disease. His work helped to establish early detection programs across the country, saving countless lives.

In addition to his medical career, Hart was also a successful novelist, publishing four books. He lived a full life as a man, married for 37 years, and was a respected member of his community. His life is a testament to the long history of transgender people making significant contributions to society.
