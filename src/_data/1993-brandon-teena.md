Brandon Teena was a young transgender man from Lincoln, Nebraska, whose life was tragically cut short. After moving to the small town of Falls City, Nebraska, he found friendship and romance, living as a man. However, after his transgender status was discovered, he was brutally raped and murdered by two male acquaintances in December 1993.

The horrific nature of the crime, and the local law enforcement's mishandling of the case, drew national attention. His story became a powerful symbol of the violence and prejudice that transgender people face. 

The 1999 film "Boys Don't Cry," based on his life, was a critical success, earning Hilary Swank an Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Brandon. The film and the accompanying documentary, "The Brandon Teena Story," played a crucial role in educating the public about the realities of transgender existence and the urgent need for hate crime laws to protect transgender individuals. His legacy is a somber but vital part of the fight for transgender rights and visibility.
