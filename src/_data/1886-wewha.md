We'wha was a highly respected member of the Zuni tribe and one of the most famous lhamana, a traditional third-gender role in Zuni culture. Born in 1849, We'wha was biologically male but lived and dressed as a woman, undertaking tasks associated with both men and women. This blended role was not seen as contradictory within Zuni society but as a unique and spiritually significant identity.

We'wha was a talented weaver and potter, and their artistic skills were widely recognized. In 1886, they traveled to Washington D.C. with anthropologist Matilda Coxe Stevenson. During this trip, We'wha served as a cultural ambassador, meeting with prominent figures, including President Grover Cleveland, who were largely unaware of We'wha's assigned sex at birth.

We'wha's life and the lhamana tradition challenge Western colonial concepts of gender and sexuality. They represent a historical example of a non-binary gender identity being integrated and revered within a society. We'wha's story is a vital part of both Native American and transgender history.
