Dr. Renee Richards is a pioneering transgender athlete and esteemed medical professional. Born in New York City, she was a successful ophthalmologist and a talented amateur tennis player as a man. After undergoing gender confirmation surgery in 1975, she began living as Renee Richards.

In 1976, she sought to enter the US Open women's tournament, but the United States Tennis Association (USTA) refused, citing a new policy requiring female competitors to pass a chromosome test. Richards challenged the decision, and in a historic 1977 ruling, the New York Supreme Court found that the USTA's requirement was "grossly unfair, discriminatory and inequitable, and a violation of her rights."

The ruling was a landmark victory for transgender rights in sports. Richards went on to compete professionally for several years, reaching a career-high ranking of 20th in the world. After retiring from tennis, she returned to her successful medical practice, becoming a leading expert in pediatric strabismus surgery. Her courage and legal battle paved the way for future generations of transgender athletes.
