  <h1>About the Trans History Project</h1>
  
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>The Trans History Project is dedicated to documenting and preserving the rich and diverse history of transgender individuals and communities. Our goal is to create a comprehensive, accessible resource that highlights the contributions, struggles, and achievements of trans people throughout history.</p>
    
    <p>By sharing these stories, we aim to educate the public, combat erasure, and inspire future generations of transgender individuals by showing them that they are part of a long and proud tradition of resilience and self-expression.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Transgender history is often overlooked, misrepresented, or actively erased from mainstream historical narratives. This erasure contributes to the marginalization of trans people and makes it difficult for trans individuals to see themselves reflected in history.</p>
    
    <p>By documenting and sharing these stories, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Honor the lives and contributions of transgender individuals throughout history</li>
      <li>Challenge stereotypes and misconceptions about transgender people</li>
      <li>Provide role models and historical context for transgender individuals today</li>
      <li>Create educational resources for allies and the general public</li>
      <li>Preserve important cultural and historical knowledge for future generations</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>While we strive for accuracy, we recognize that historical terminology and understandings of gender have varied across time and cultures. We use contemporary language to describe historical figures in a way that is respectful and accessible to modern audiences, while acknowledging that these individuals may have used different language to describe themselves during their lifetimes.</p>
